# comparse: CObol Math PARSE
This is a math parser written in gnuCOBOL for fun. It interfaces with the [Orca library](https://github.com/cee-studio/orca) to take in statements via Discord.

## why?
To satisfy my own curiosity, and hopefully yours aswell. Writing a math parser is easy; writing one in a language based around tons of random keywords that the entire industry gave up on is a different story. Want to hire me to work on your COBOL project? I'd love to help! [Hit me up.](https://www.nicklausw.com/contact)

## will you redo the discord stuff in COBOL?
Nah. That strays slightly too far from the purpose of the language, keeping in mind that it was invented 2 decades before the internet. Besides, Orca is a wonderful library. Why would I stop using it?
